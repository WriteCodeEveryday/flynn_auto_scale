# FlynnAutoScale
A gem that allows your Rails apps to self-scale as they need more and more resources under Flynn. Comes with an automated mode that can be used for "day to day" web hosting operations and a manual mode where you can control when scaling operations take place (for scripts, background jobs and anything else)

## Usage
Once I write the thing, I will fill this section in, I promise.

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'flynn_auto_scale'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

## Contributing
It's an open source repo, fork the thing, make some changes, and I'll put you on the list of cool people making Flynn + Rails great again.

## License
The gem is available as open source under the CC0 terms.
